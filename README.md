# galliformeshybridsynthesis
This repository holds the data and scripts necessary to reproduce the analyses in Alfieri, JM, Hingoranee, R, Athrey, GN, and Blackmon, H. 2023. Domestication is associated with increased
interspecific hybrid compatibility in landfowl (order: Galliformes). Journal of Heredity. 10.1093/jhered/esad059

# Scripts
counter_avimag.R : This script parses the occurrence of species names from text files in a directory. We have not uploaded the text files due to file size limitations, but you can use the code for your own set of species/text files.
div_eco_morpho.R: This script determines the relative importance of traits associated with reproductive isolation.
dochickenshybridizemore.R: This script is the permutation-based approach to assess the differences in mean residuals between individual species.
haldanesruleandtimetospeciation.R: This script assesses the time course of speciation and Haldane's rule.
pgls_domestication.R: This script performs the pgls between reproductive isolation and domestication.
phylogeny.R: This script plots the tree used in Figure 1.
